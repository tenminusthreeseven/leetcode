class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> sortArray(vector<int>& nums) {
        ven an array of integers nums, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in functions in O(nlog(n)) time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.
